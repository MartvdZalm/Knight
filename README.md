# Knight
Knight is a compiler for the Knight programming language. It is built using Java and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

# Reason 
I created this compiler to improve my programming skills and because I enjoy working on a project that is always evolving. Initially, I used code from other sources as I was learning how a compiler works. As I became more familiar with the process, I modified the code to fit my own preferences and style.
